## I used NodeJs a runtime environment for JS to run in the backend.

## In the choice of using cheerio or JSDom for manipulating HTML, I chose cheerio because of its lightweight and fast processing. I didn't need to execute javascript inside the HTMl so didn't need JSDom.

## I don't have the openAI api key event for gpt-3.5, so couldn't really check what is happening as of 19 Nov 23.
